## Minimum Wage: State and Federal Wage Requirements (1968-2020)

This project explores data related to state and federal minimum wage laws in the United States of America, covering states and U.S. territories. The primary objectives include:

- Utilizing the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to calculate modern-day equivalents of wages from previous years.
- Visualizing changes in minimum wage laws both within and across states from 1968 to 2020 using line plots and histograms.
- Identifying correlations between minimum wage laws and CPI trends.
- Conducting T-test analysis to pinpoint states with minimum wage laws that significantly deviate from the average.
- Employing linear regression models based on CPI to predict future increases in the federal minimum wage.

*Notable Observations:*

 - The CPI has increased on average by 4.31 per year and strongly correlates with Federal Minimum Wage law.
 - Using linear regression, the anticipated increase in the federal minimum wage requirement is $9.88. However, graph analysis indicates that individual state minimum wage laws have experienced substantial growth over the last 20 years. This growth might diminish the actual impact of the next federal law increase when it occurs.
 - Among states with minimum wage laws, six states and one U.S. Territory (Puerto Rico) were observed to be significantly different from other states.
     - Florida, Iowa, and Missouri had significantly higher minimum wages.
     - Georgia, Oklahoma, Wyoming, and Puerto Rico had significantly lower minimum wages.
 - The U.S. minimum wage requirement, based on a combination of state and federal law, has increased from an average of $1.25 in 1968 to an average of $9.08 in 2020.
 - When only considering years when states have active minimum wage laws, Florida is observed to have the highest minimum wage requirement.
 - Based on 2020 equivalents:
     - Federal minimum wage laws have shown an overall flat trend. Although there were some acute increases and decreases, notably the decline from 1979 to 1990, since 1990 there has been a slight increasing trend. It's important to note that the minimum wage in 2020 is still less than its 1968 equivalent
     - State minimum wage law averages have generally followed a similar pattern. However, the increasing trend since 1990 has been stronger, with an increasing number of states passing minimum wage requirements higher than the federal minimum wage law. Notably, Florida, which did not have a state law in effect until 2006, boasts the highest average minimum wage requirement among all states and territories.
